前两天在新浪微博里看到<a href="http://t.sina.com.cn/kaifulee">李开复</a>提到了这个演讲，在youtube上搜了一下，的确不错，就下载了下来传到优酷上，以便墙内的朋友们能看到。

ps:我在youtube上看到好的视频通常会下载下来传到优酷上，也算是为墙内的朋友们做了点贡献。我的优酷首页为：<a href="http://u.youku.com/user_show/id_UMjkzNjc4MTIw.html">http://u.youku.com/user_show/id_UMjkzNjc4MTIw.html</a>，我上传的视频主要跟互联网，创业，idea有关，都是我非常喜欢的视频。

Jonathan Rosenberg的视频在这：

正如李开发所说的那样：“这个是一个信息量非常大的演讲，每一句话都是原创的智慧之言，但是每句话都无关。30分钟讲了几百个原创重点，听众的头脑都跟不上他的嘴。”

好久没写博客了，主要是最近实在太忙，忙着期中考试，忙着操作系统的project，现在也没有时间翻译这个视频。

如果你听不懂的话，建议你不要去网上找字幕了，现在肯定找不到，还不如多听几遍，还能提高一下听力水平。

我在google上找了<a href="http://www.arpitonline.com/blog/2010/04/03/notes-from-jonathan-rosenbergs-talk-on-rules-to-success/">一篇这个演讲的notes</a>，大概把要点列了出来，看看这个对于理解这个视频肯定有帮助。

<strong>Rules on Communication</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Overcommunicate always all the time. You cant communcate enough.</li>
	<li>Openly share everything with your collegues. Trust your people and give them this info. Trust breeds loyalty.</li>
	<li>Repetition does not spoil the prayer.</li>
	<li>Each word matters. Be crisp and direct and choose each word wisely. Its is not rambling: Leave out the parts that people skip. “I would have written a shorter letter if I had the time” : Mark Twain</li>
	<li>Great leaders are great teachers and great teachers are great storytellers. Narrative is what that matters.</li>
	<li>On Talking:
<ul>
	<li>As leaders you learn more by listening than talking. Listening makes you humble and smart. When you listen you learn how things work, when you talk, you echo how you think things work.</li>
	<li>If you must talk, ask questions. People learn more about you from your questions</li>
	<li>If you actually know the answer in a business situation, talk, but back up with data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Try to respond instantly. If you dont respond instantly, everything stalls.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Rules on Culture:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Avoid Hippos: (Highest paid person’s opinion)</li>
	<li>You should not be able to read an org chart by looking at the product (for example, you cant look at the apple org chart when you look at the ipod).</li>
	<li>Healthy orgs crush bureaucracy in all forms.</li>
	<li>Ask for winning strategy and look for good tactics.</li>
	<li>People are more productive when they are crowded. Social groups moderate bad behavior.</li>
	<li>Empower the smallest of teams. Small teams accomplish more. Read the mythical man month. Create teams about the size of a family.</li>
	<li>Working from home is cancer. Ban it.</li>
	<li>Engineers and product managers add complexity, marketing adds management layers, sales adds coordinators.</li>
	<li>Knights are knights and knaves are knaves. <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Peters');" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Peters">Tom Peters</a>: There is no momentary lapse of integrety.</li>
	<li>Focus on value rather than costs.</li>
	<li>Never suggest copying a competitor. You can do better.</li>
	<li>Hope is not a plan.</li>
	<li>Success breeds the green eyed monster. Take away with surprise and humility.</li>
	<li>Do all re-orgs in a day</li>
</ul>
<strong>Rules on Hiring:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Know how to interview well.</li>
	<li>Gimmicks like free food, games, etc aren’t that important. People come to google to work with great people.</li>
	<li>Managers don’t hire people. Committees hire people.</li>
	<li>Promotions should be a peer review process.</li>
	<li>Instead of laying off the bottom 10% dont hire anymore.</li>
	<li>Dont hire specialists, esp in high tech. Change is the only thing permanent. “I have no special talent just passionate curiosity.” : Einstein.</li>
	<li>You cannot teach passion. Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm. If the enthusiasm isn’t palpable in a room, its not there.</li>
	<li>Urgency of a role isnt important enough for a quick hire.</li>
	<li>Identify and purge bad eggs.</li>
	<li>Diversity is your best defense against myopia.</li>
	<li>You cannot punt the management training program.</li>
	<li>Life is not fair. Disproportionately reward risk takers and  performers. Don’t tell people they did a good job if they didn’t. Real life is a meritocracy. Celebrate and reward what you want to see more of.</li>
	<li>Build around the people who have the most impact.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Rules on Decision Making:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Decision making is about concesus and not unanimity. Dont spend hours towards unanimity. Good enough is better. <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire');" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire">Voltaire</a>: “Perfect is enemy of the good”.</li>
	<li>There is no consensus w/o dissent. Patton: If everyone is thinking alike then someone isnt thinking.</li>
	<li>If there is doubt about what to do think abt customers perspective.</li>
	<li>Choose your goals wisely. If the goals create conflict change the goals.</li>
	<li>No-one of us is smarter than all of us.</li>
	<li>Where there is harmony there is no innovation. Discuss and arguement leads new ideas and new meaning. Innovation comes from disagreement.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Rules on Fostering Innovation:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>You cannot manage creativity to manage risks. Innovation comes from creativity.</li>
	<li>Create a culture of yes based on optimism and big thinking.</li>
	<li>Never stop someone from a good idea for a better one. Darwinian rule works. Best ideas win and others fail.</li>
	<li>A leaders job is not to prevent risk but to recover from failures fast. Good failure happens quickly.</li>
	<li>A good crisis is a terrible thing to waste. Nothing teaches like a crisis.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Rules on Humility</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Learn something new to remember how hard its to learn. Teach something so you can learn.</li>
	<li>Never stop learning. School is never out.</li>
	<li>Humility is correlated with age. Arrogance is inversely correlated with age.</li>
	<li>You get personal leverage from delegation and inspection. Smart people suorround themselves with smart people.</li>
	<li> Judgement comes from experience and experience comes from errors. You learn more from your msitakes. At google screwups are written and archived to learn from for the future.</li>
	<li>Smart ppl can smell hypocracy. Make sure you spend ur time on things you say is important. Culture is set from the top.</li>
	<li>Don’t burn bridges.</li>
	<li>Would you work for yourself?</li>
	<li>Write a self review and be critical about yourself.</li>
	<li>Communicate and confess when you make a mistake.</li>
</ul>
